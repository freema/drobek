# drobek — implementation progress (the `/implement` loop)

Working memory for the Linear-driven loop (project **Drobek**, team Nsoft,
NSO-279..NSO-308). The plan is [`vision-plan.md`](./vision-plan.md); the
one-page pitch is [`navrh-drobek.md`](./navrh-drobek.md). All work lands on the
single long-lived `next` branch; pushes happen only at milestone end.

## Current state

- Branch `next` was created from `origin/main` (b0443d8, PR #1 merged) on
  2026-09-22.
- **M0-01 (NSO-279) — one process, one image.** `apps/web` + `apps/mcp-server`
  → `apps/server` (Express + `@react-router/express` + `mountMcpResource` at
  `/mcp`). The BullMQ worker container and `scripts/worker.mjs` are gone; the
  deploy consumer + audit prune run in-process (`apps/server/server/jobs.ts`)
  until M0-02 removes the upload pipeline. Root `Dockerfile` (`dev` + `runner`
  targets) → `ghcr.io/freema/drobek`. The server migrates itself on start
  (`runCoreMigrations`) and refuses placeholder secrets
  (`@drobek/core` `secretsConfigError`). MCP resource = `PUBLIC_APP_URL + /mcp`.

## Next

- M0-02 (NSO-280): version data model + drop the upload pipeline. Remove the
  in-process deploy consumer from `apps/server/server/jobs.ts` together with
  `@drobek/deploy` (keep the audit prune).

## Notes and gotchas

- The containerd image store reports the **compressed** size in
  `docker image inspect .Size`; `scripts/prod-proof.sh` measures the unpacked
  root filesystem (`du -sxm /`) instead.
- `pnpm deploy --legacy` copies whole workspace package dirs (incl. `dist/`,
  `drizzle/`), not a `files`-filtered pack.
- `typescript` arrives as an optional peer of `@react-router/{node,express}`;
  the Dockerfile deletes it from the prod tree (typegen only).
- drobek-web still has its own `apps/web` + `apps/mcp-server` + worker glue
  pinned to the old core submodule sha — it adapts when M0-09 bumps the
  submodule.

- Dev mode runs Vite in middleware mode inside the server; its HMR websocket
  MUST share the app's HTTP server (`hmr: { server }`) — the default port
  24678 is not published from the container and breaks the dashboard
  (caught by the console-clean `auth-smoke` spec).
- e2e now hits Express in dev too (before, `react-router dev` = Vite/connect),
  so text responses carry `; charset=utf-8` like production always did.
- Docker Desktop's VM clock drifts after the Mac sleeps (seen: 15 min behind),
  which breaks token-expiry specs; resync with
  `docker run --rm --privileged alpine:3 hwclock -s`. A sleeping/throttled
  host also produces spurious login-navigation timeouts — rerun the failing
  specs before debugging them.
- The full e2e suite needs Playwright Chromium on the host:
  `pnpm -C tests-e2e exec playwright install chromium`.

## Failed approaches

- `pnpm deploy --offline` in the Dockerfile builder: fails with
  `ERR_PNPM_NO_OFFLINE_META` (deploy re-resolves peer ranges and needs registry
  metadata that `pnpm fetch` does not cache). Keep deploy online.
